**circStudio**
================
*Under construction*

**circStudio** is a package for mathematical modelling of circadian rhythms using actigraphy data. It was built on top of the open-source python package for actigraphy and light exposure data visualization called **pyActigraphy**, and conserves some of the original functionality. It is able to calculate rest-activity rhythm variables (e.g., IS, IV), light-derived metrics (e.g., TAT, MLiT). Additionally, a graphical user interface is provided, so that the user can choose either to use a programmatic or interactive interface to perform actigraphy data analyses.
The motivation for this package stems from the need to analyze actigraphy data in Python 3.12 and later, but also to add mathematical models of circadian rhythms to the analysis pipeline.
